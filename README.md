# Project-Peace.

This project was built for the Cohere 2023 Hackathon.

## Description

Project Peace is an AI-powered tool that aims to detect and detoxify toxicity in multilingual texts. Using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, the tool analyzes text to identify instances of toxic language, including hate speech, profanity, and aggressive language. Once toxic language is detected, Project Peace replaces or modifies the toxic words with more neutral words to detoxify the text, reducing the harm it may cause. The tool is intended to be used as an API endpoint or integrated into existing platforms to make it widely accessible and effective in combating toxicity. The goal remains to promote peace and reduce harm by reducing the spread of toxic messages online, across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
